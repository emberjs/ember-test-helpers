/**
 * Mimics character by character entry into the target `input` or `textarea` element.
 *
 * Allows for simulation of slow entry by passing an optional millisecond delay
 * between key events.

 * The major difference between `typeIn` and `fillIn` is that `typeIn` triggers
 * keyboard events as well as `input` and `change`.
 * Typically this looks like `focus` -> `focusin` -> `keydown` -> `keypress` -> `keyup` -> `input` -> `change`
 * per character of the passed text (this may vary on some browsers).
 *
 * @public
 * @param {string|Element|IDOMElementDescriptor} target the element, selector, or descriptor to enter text into
 * @param {string} text the test to fill the element with
 * @param {Object} options {delay: x} (default 50) number of milliseconds to wait per keypress
 * @return {Promise<void>} resolves when the application is settled
 *
 * @example
 * <caption>
 *   Emulating typing in an input using `typeIn`
 * </caption>
 *
 * typeIn('input', 'hello world');
