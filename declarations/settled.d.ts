  Check various settledness metrics, and return an object with the following properties:

  - `hasRunLoop` - Checks if a run-loop has been started. If it has, this will
    be `true` otherwise it will be `false`.
  - `hasPendingTimers` - Checks if there are scheduled timers in the run-loop.
    These pending timers are primarily registered by `Ember.run.schedule`. If
    there are pending timers, this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
  - `hasPendingWaiters` - Checks if any registered test waiters are still
    pending (e.g. the waiter returns `true`). If there are pending waiters,
    this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
  - `hasPendingRequests` - Checks if there are pending AJAX requests (based on
    `ajaxSend` / `ajaxComplete` events triggered by `jQuery.ajax`). If there
    are pending requests, this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
  - `hasPendingTransitions` - Checks if there are pending route transitions. If the
    router has not been instantiated / setup for the test yet this will return `null`,
    if there are pending transitions, this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
  - `pendingRequestCount` - The count of pending AJAX requests.
  - `debugInfo` - Debug information that's combined with info return from backburner's
    getDebugInfo method.
  - `isRenderPending` - Checks if there are any pending render operations. This will be true as long
    as there are tracked values in the template that have not been rerendered yet.
