/**
  Creates an "owner" (an object that either _is_ or duck-types like an
  `Ember.ApplicationInstance`) from the provided options.

  If `options.application` is present (e.g. setup by an earlier call to
  `setApplication`) an `Ember.ApplicationInstance` is built via
  `application.buildInstance()`.

  If `options.application` is not present, we fall back to using
  `options.resolver` instead (setup via `setResolver`). This creates a mock
  "owner" by using a custom created combination of `Ember.Registry`,
  `Ember.Container`, `Ember._ContainerProxyMixin`, and
  `Ember._RegistryProxyMixin`.
