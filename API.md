It also requires the developer to provide either a string with the [`key`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key/Key_Values)
or the numeric [`keyCode`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/keyCode) of the pressed key.
Optionally the user can also provide a POJO with extra modifiers for the event.

**Parameters**

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;void>** resolves when the application is settled

### typeIn

Mimics character by character entry into the target `input` or `textarea` element.

Allows for simulation of slow entry by passing an optional millisecond delay
between key events.

The major difference between `typeIn` and `fillIn` is that `typeIn` triggers
keyboard events as well as `input` and `change`.
Typically this looks like `focus` -> `focusin` -> `keydown` -> `keypress` -> `keyup` -> `input` -> `change`
per character of the passed text (this may vary on some browsers).

**Parameters**

-   `target` **([string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) \| [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element))** the element or selector to enter text into
-   `text` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the test to fill the element with
-   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** {delay: x} (default 50) number of milliseconds to wait per keypress (optional, default `{delay:50}`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;void>** resolves when the application is settled

`willDestroyElement`).

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;void>** resolves when settled

## Wait Helpers




### waitFor

Used to wait for a particular selector to appear in the DOM. Due to the fact
that it does not wait for general settledness, this is quite useful for testing
interim DOM states (e.g. loading states, pending promises, etc).

**Parameters**

-   `selector` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the selector to wait for
-   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** the options to be used (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.timeout` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the time to wait (in ms) for a match (optional, default `1000`)
    -   `options.count` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the number of elements that should match the provided selector (null means one or more) (optional, default `null`)
    -   `options.timeoutMessage`  

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;([Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element) \| [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element)>)>** resolves when the element(s) appear on the page

### waitUntil

Wait for the provided callback to return a truthy value.

This does not leverage `settled()`, and as such can be used to manage async
while _not_ settled (e.g. "loading" or "pending" states).

**Parameters**

-   `callback` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** the callback to use for testing when waiting should stop
-   `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)?** options used to override defaults (optional, default `{}`)
    -   `options.timeout` **[number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)** the maximum amount of time to wait (optional, default `1000`)
    -   `options.timeoutMessage` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** the message to use in the reject on timeout (optional, default `'waitUntil timed out'`)

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** resolves with the callback value when it returns a truthy value

### settled

Returns a promise that resolves when in a settled state (see `isSettled` for
a definition of "settled state").

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;void>** resolves when settled

### isSettled

Checks various settledness metrics (via `getSettledState()`) to determine if things are settled or not.

Settled generally means that there are no pending timers, no pending waiters,
no pending AJAX requests, and no current run loop. However, new settledness
metrics may be added and used as they become available.

Returns **[boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)** `true` if settled, `false` otherwise

### getSettledState

Check various settledness metrics, and return an object with the following properties:

-   `hasRunLoop` - Checks if a run-loop has been started. If it has, this will
    be `true` otherwise it will be `false`.
-   `hasPendingTimers` - Checks if there are scheduled timers in the run-loop.
    These pending timers are primarily registered by `Ember.run.schedule`. If
    there are pending timers, this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
-   `hasPendingWaiters` - Checks if any registered test waiters are still
    pending (e.g. the waiter returns `true`). If there are pending waiters,
    this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
-   `hasPendingRequests` - Checks if there are pending AJAX requests (based on
    `ajaxSend` / `ajaxComplete` events triggered by `jQuery.ajax`). If there
    are pending requests, this will be `true`, otherwise `false`.
-   `pendingRequestCount` - The count of pending AJAX requests.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** object with properties for each of the metrics used to determine settledness

## Pause Helpers




### pauseTest

Returns a promise to be used to pauses the current test (due to being
returned from the test itself).  This is useful for debugging while testing
or for test-driving.  It allows you to inspect the state of your application
at any point.

The test framework wrapper (e.g. `ember-qunit` or `ember-mocha`) should
ensure that when `pauseTest()` is used, any framework specific test timeouts
are disabled.

**Examples**

Usage via ember-qunit


```javascript
import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit';
import { render, click, pauseTest } from '@ember/test-helpers';


module('awesome-sauce', function(hooks) {
  setupRenderingTest(hooks);

  test('does something awesome', async function(assert) {
    await render(hbs`{{awesome-sauce}}`);

    // added here to visualize / interact with the DOM prior
    // to the interaction below
    await pauseTest();

    click('.some-selector');

    assert.equal(this.element.textContent, 'this sauce is awesome!');
  });
});
```

Returns **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)&lt;void>** resolves _only_ when `resumeTest()` is invoked

### resumeTest

### validateErrorHandler

Validate the provided error handler to confirm that it properly re-throws
errors when `Ember.testing` is true.

This is intended to be used by test framework hosts (or other libraries) to
ensure that `Ember.onerror` is properly configured. Without a check like
this, `Ember.onerror` could _easily_ swallow all errors and make it _seem_
like everything is just fine (and have green tests) when in reality
everything is on fire...

**Parameters**

-   `callback` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** the callback to validate (optional, default `Ember.onerror`)

**Examples**

Example implementation for `ember-qunit`


```javascript
import { validateErrorHandler } from '@ember/test-helpers';

test('Ember.onerror is functioning properly', function(assert) {
  let result = validateErrorHandler();
  assert.ok(result.isValid, result.message);
});
```

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** object with `isValid` and `message`
