@ember/test-helpers [![CI Build](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-test-helpers/actions/workflows/ci-build.yml)
==============================================================================

A test-framework-agnostic set of helpers for testing Ember.js applications

Compatibility
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Ember 3.8 or above
- Ember CLI 3.8 or above
- Node.js 10 or above


Installation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### For ember-qunit v5 and above

#### yarn
```bash
yarn add --dev @ember/test-helpers
````

#### npm
```bash
npm install --save-dev @ember/test-helpers
```

### For ember-qunit v4 and below
If you are writing a regular Ember app or addon there is not much for you to
do as [ember-qunit](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-qunit) (and
[ember-mocha](https://github.com/emberjs/ember-mocha)) already include this
package as a dependency. You only need to make sure that you are using a
recent enough version of either one of these packages.

If you are working on `ember-qunit` or `ember-mocha` themselves you can
install this package like any other regular Ember addon. 


Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package exports several helper functions that can be used to improve
the testing experience when developing Ember.js apps or addons.

These helper functions include DOM interaction helpers (`click()`, `fillIn()`,
...), routing and rendering helpers (`visit()`, `render()`, ...) and some
other things that make it easy to write good tests.

**The full documentation can be found in the [API reference](API.md).**
