/**
  Returns a promise which will resolve when rendering has completed. In
  this context, rendering is completed when all auto-tracked state that is
  consumed in the template (including any tracked state in models, services,
  etc.  that are then used in a template) has been updated in the DOM.

  For example, in a test you might want to update some tracked state and
  then run some assertions after rendering has completed. You _could_ use
  `await settled()` in that location, but in some contexts you don't want to
  wait for full settledness (which includes test waiters, pending AJAX/fetch,
  run loops, etc) but instead only want to know when that updated value has
  been rendered in the DOM. **THAT** is what `await rerender()` is _perfect_
  for.

  @returns {Promise<void>} a promise which fulfills when rendering has completed
